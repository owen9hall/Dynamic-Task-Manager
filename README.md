# Dynamic Task Manager

## Description

Ez-Pz Planner is a dynamic task manager designed to simplify task management. Many existing applications are overly complex, leading to distractions and wasted time. This tool provides a minimalistic, sleek interface and provides a visual for users to see exactly the order in which they should complete their tasks based on the individual data of each task.  
  
This project was built using the Flask framework (Python). I used SQL databases to store the user accounts and assignment information. For the UI/UX, I used HTML and CSS.

## Key Features
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Task prioritization to help you focus on what to work on next
- User accounts for personalized task management

## Installation
  1. Open the terminal and enter the directory you would like to open the project in.
  2. In the terminal type the separate commands:

   git clone https://github.com/owen9hall/Dynamic-Task-Manager.git  
   cd Dynamic-Task-Manager/venv  
   python -m pip install flask  
   python -m flask run  
  3. You should be given a link to a development server: http://127.0.0.1:5000  
   Open the link in your browser. You can now use the Ez-Pz Planner.
