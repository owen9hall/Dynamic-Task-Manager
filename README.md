# Dynamic Task Manager

## Description

I am a very organized person, so I have spent time using many different kinds of task managers over the years. Two common issues I found:
  1. They were overcomplicated. They had many features that were distracting and unnecessary, resulting in more visual clutter and more time spent on the application trying to organize my tasks and less time actually completing my tasks.
  2. They didn't help me answer the question of: "What task should I work on first?" I yearned for an application that could tell me the exact priority of each of my tasks so I wouldn't spend any time reading and analyzing each of my tasks in order to figure out which to work on next.
To solve these issues, I created my owen task manager: Ez-Pz Planner

This project was built using the Flask framework (Python). I used SQL databases to store the user accounts and assignment information. For the UI/UX, I used HTML and CSS.

## Installation
# 1. Open the terminal and enter the directory you would like to open the project in.
# 2. In the terminal type the separate commands:
   git init
   git clone https://github.com/owen9hall/Dynamic-Task-Manager.git
   cd Dynamic-Task-Manager/venv
   python -m pip install flask
   python -m flask run
# 3. You should be given a link to a development server: http://127.0.0.1:5000
   Open the link in your browser. You can now use the Ez-Pz Planner.
